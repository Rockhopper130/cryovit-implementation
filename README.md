## CryoViT Implementation
This repository contains implementations of CryoViT, a Vision Transformer-based model designed for analyzing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. The implementation supports both supervised and semi-supervised training approaches.

### Notebooks
- `cryovit-supervised.ipynb` : End-to-end pipeline for training CryoViT in a fully supervised manner.
- `cryovit-semi-supervised.ipynb` : Pipeline for training CryoViT using a semi-supervised approach, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data.
